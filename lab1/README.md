# Lab 1 - IPv4 network configuration

The main goal of this lab is to configure IPv4 networks on **Khatara**.

- Manual configuration: via **interfaces**, **ip** and **ipconfig**.

- Automated configuration: implementation of **dhcp** with udhcp.

Once the labs are set up it is possible to capture the traffic between machines and store it with **tcpdump** to read it later via **wireshark**.
